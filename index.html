                <div class="float-left"><img src="assets/images/demo.gif"></div><b>The Kirby Button </b>is a web-based application featuring a walking Kirby and chef Kirby floating above him. With chef Kirby as the button, the user is meant to interact with him to feed walking
                Kirby, cast a spell on the magical meme mirror, or cause walking Kirby to transform into one of his many copy abilities. Our application effectively showcases Kirby's unique abilities, his love for delicious food, and his social media
                presence with just one interactive button.

                <h2>1. Brainstorming</h2>
                We began our project by brainstorming ideas and concepts we wanted our button to be based on. After sharing our ideas with each other, we decided to proceed with my idea of a Kirby button. We chose him because he is a popular character from Nintendo,
                an international leader in the interactive entertainment industry, with many likeable and memorable characteristics. He's pink, round, and cute, so what's not to like? He is also a hyperactive character with numerous movesets and facial
                expressions, therefore, we were confident that we'd be able to produce a high quality button with unique interactions if Kirby is the main character.
                <div class="float-left"><img src="assets/images/kirbyblink.gif"></div>Here are my initial notes on this idea:
                <br><br>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kirby Button</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Different Kirbies: ice Kirby, sleeping Kirby, fire Kirby, etc.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kirby state could change every 10-15 seconds or so</li>
                        <li>Event that's triggered will depend on which Kirby type you click on
                            <ul>
                                <li>E.g. if sleeping Kirby is clicked, Kirby wakes up startled</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Could also explore other Smash Bros characters</li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>b. M tomato as the button</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kirby is hurt/low health</li>
                        <li>Press m tomato button &rarr; Kirby is healed</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>2. Ten Design Ideas</h2>
                Each group member then had to sketch 10 initial design ideas centering on Kirby and his likeness to present to each other. After studying some of Nintendo's most popular games in the Kirby series, we realized that the young, pink hero was capable of a
                lot. He could cook, he could float through the air with an umbrella, he could even paint art. With the endless opportunities before us, I decided to just focus on what I liked the most about Kirby. I sketched him as the many entertaining
                memes of him I've seen online. I also highlighted his ability to eat his enemies and take their powers as his own. Some of us had ideas that were more reminiscent thanto a game concept because they would lead to either a positive or negative
                outcome depending on the choices of the user.

                After looking at each member's sketches, we agreed as a group that our button should be less of a game and more about Kirby and his unique personality and appearance. We chose these sketches as our top 10 concept sketches because they allowed the user
                to make discoveries about Kirby's likes and dislikes and the capacity of his powers. We did not choose the sketches that made the button into a game because we wanted the focus to be on Kirby and not on winning a game.

                Moving forward, we decided on three designs we would base our refinement sketches on. The sketch design ideas we chose as our top three were:

                </div>
                <br><br> We chose these three because we believed that we could expand these sketches to showcase Kirby's multi-faceted personality while uncovering what makes Kirby, well, Kirby. We knew that he loved to eat certain foods, he steals the
                abilities of his enemies by inhaling them, and that there are a myriad of Kirby memes that exist online. We did not move forward with the other initial design sketches because we did not believe that they captured Kirby's essence adequately.
                For example, we did not choose the "Kirby Paint and Canvas" sketch that I (Sophia) designed because we wanted to challenge ourselves by having just one singular button in our program instead of multiple. We also wanted our button to involve
                Kirby's famous "inhaling" and transformation ability, thus why we scrapped the "Kirby Paint and Canvas" idea. Here are the top 10 sketches we came up with based on the aforementioned three sketches:

                For our final product, we pulled ideas from several of our refinement sketches. Once we began to code our program, we decided on implementing the features of:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Chef Kirby button </b>that drops a variety of items every time it is interacted with as inspired by "Refined Sketch 10 by Sophia"</li>
                    <li>Traverse through collection of <b>Kirby memes</b> and display them as inspired by "Refined Sketch 5 by Daniel" and "Refined Sketch 8 by Sophia"</li>
                    <li><b>Kirby walks</b> towards items that he eventually reacts to as inspired by "Refined Sketch 8 by Sophia"</li>
                    <li><b>Change background</b> depending on Kirby's active power (e.g. ice, fire, sword) as inspired by "Refined Sketch 1 by Marela"</li>

                <h2>4. Final Product</h2>
                Our final product was the result of three main ideas: Kirby eating food, Kirby stealing abilities, and Kirby being a meme. The technology we used to create our button are Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our button works by clicking on Chef Kirby. If
                he is single clicked, a copy item will drop onto the grass platform and steadily move towards Kirby. Once Kirby is close enough, he'll inhale the copy item and absorb its powers. If Chef Kirby is double clicked, he'll drop a meme tomato
                and a random Kirby meme will appear on the magic mirror once Kirby inhales it. Lastly, if the mouse is held down over Chef Kirby, he will cook up a random dish for Kirby enjoy. Once Kirby eats the food, he will exclaim "Poyo!" to express
                his satisfaction. Our program also features an informative loading screen and a background music toggle button. Find out more by watching the video below:
